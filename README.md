# Bayzat Backend Coding Excercise

Welcome! In this excercise, you are asked to develop a simple RESTful service.

The service will provide functionality to create, read, update and delete certain entities, namely: Company, Employee, Dependant.

Companies can have multiple employees and employees can have multiple dependants. Furthermore, they have the specific attributes:

Company
- Name
- Address

Employee
- Name
- Phone number
- Gender
- Date of birth
- Salary

Dependant
- Name
- Phone number
- Gender
- Date of birth
- Relation to employee

## Notes
- Use **Symfony Framework (PHP)** or **Spring Boot** (any jvm language).
- Expose a **REST API**, no frontend is required.
- Usage of **kotlin** will be considered a plus.
- Usage of **API Blueprint** will be considered a plus.
- Proper unit testing and coverage will be considered a plus.
- Improvise where details are omitted.
